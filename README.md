Corvallis Tour
============================

The Corvallis Tour application is an accompanying website for a guided tour in Corvallis.

It detects a touring person's location, display where they are on a map, and show a variety of images and descriptions for each location. A location represents a "stop" on the tour and thus each will be separated by a significant distance.
